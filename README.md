## 📦 Components Overview

### `gist/build-static-analysis.gradle`
> A reusable Gradle build script fragment for static code analysis tooling (e.g., Checkstyle, PMD, SpotBugs).  
🔧 **Usage:** Import it into your `build.gradle` files for unified code linting across modules.


### `scripts/design.sh`
> Shell script to convert system design descriptions into visual diagrams (likely using `draw.io`, `mermaid`, or similar engines).  
🧠 Ideal for: Converting plaintext system architecture into shareable visuals.


### `scripts/macos/`
> Reserved for macOS-specific scripts such as default setup, environment tweaks, and automation helpers.  
🍏 Useful for: Onboarding new Macs or setting up dev environments consistently.


### `scripts/pyproject.sh`
> Automates the creation of a new Python project using Poetry.  
🐍 Features:
- Creates folder structure
- Initializes `pyproject.toml`
- Sets up virtualenv and installs dependencies  
✅ Run this to rapidly scaffold new Poetry projects.

### `scripts/temporal.sh`
> Script to bootstrap or manage a Temporal.io microservice.  
⏱️ Could include helpers to:
- Generate service scaffolding
- Manage workflow workers
- Connect with Temporal server locally
