# Java Backend Framework Comparison


The document list the comparison between various java backend framework.  The main reason I started looking at other frameworks was to learn and understand if there are better alternatives and try these out to determine pros/cons of each.

### üîß **General-Purpose Full-Stack Frameworks (like Spring Boot)**

| Framework       | Description                                                                              | Pros                                                                                  | Cons                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spring Boot** | Opinionated framework built on Spring Core for rapid microservices development.          | Huge ecosystem, community support, production-grade tooling (Actuator, Spring Cloud). | Steep learning curve, sometimes heavyweight.        |
| **Micronaut**   | Modern, lightweight framework designed for cloud-native and serverless apps.             | Fast startup (no reflection), GraalVM support, DI at compile time.                    | Smaller community, fewer integrations than Spring.  |
| **Quarkus**     | Kubernetes-native Java stack tailored for GraalVM and OpenJDK.                           | Fast startup, low memory usage, optimized for containerized environments.             | Immature compared to Spring, limited documentation. |
| **Helidon**     | Oracle-backed, designed for microservices; supports both reactive and imperative styles. | Native image support, small footprint.                                                | Limited ecosystem, less abstraction.                |

| **Dagger**         | Compile-time DI from Google, commonly used in Android. | Very fast, type-safe, no reflection. | Verbose, complex setup, less flexible. |
| **PicoContainer**  | DI container with minimal footprint.                   | Very lightweight, simple to use.     | Rarely used, very small community.     |


### üåê **Web Frameworks (Spring MVC Alternatives)**

| Framework                         | Description                                                   | Pros                                                      | Cons                                           |

| **Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE)** | Official enterprise Java standard.                            | Standardized, supported by app servers (Payara, WildFly). | Slower innovation, heavier than Spring Boot.   |
| **Javalin**                       | Lightweight web framework inspired by Express.js and Koa.     | Simple API, suitable for microservices and REST.          | No native DI, limited features.                |
| **Spark Java**                    | Micro web framework for REST APIs.                            | Easy to learn, functional style.                          | Lacks ecosystem, not ideal for large projects. |
| **Vert.x**                        | Event-driven, non-blocking toolkit for reactive applications. | Reactive performance, polyglot support.                   | Steeper learning curve, unconventional style.  |


### üîÑ **Reactive Frameworks (Spring WebFlux Alternatives)**
